Week 2: Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

Welcome to the repository for Week 2 of our Java learning journey. 
This week focused on mastering the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and understanding how Java enables modular, reusable, and scalable code through classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.

Overview:
The second week focused on learning the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. 
Topics included creating and managing classes and objects, working with constructors and access modifiers, understanding inheritance and polymorphism, and modeling real-world systems through class diagrams. 
These concepts are critical for writing modular and maintainable Java programs.

Topics Covered:
Day 1: Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals:
● Understanding Objects and Classes
● Four Pillars of OOP: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
● Benefits of OOP in Java
● Creating classes and objects
● Real-world analogies for OOP concepts

Day 2: Constructors, Instance vs. Class Variables, Access Modifiers:
● Types of constructors: Default, Parameterized
● this() constructor call
● Instance (object-level) vs. Class (static) variables
● Java access modifiers: private, default, protected, public
● Importance of encapsulation in access control

Day 3: this, static, final Keywords and instanceof Operator:
● this keyword usage and constructor chaining
● static keyword: methods and variables
● final keyword for variables, methods, and classes
● Using instanceof to check object types
● Static blocks and static methods

Day 4: Object Modeling and Class Diagram:
● Introduction to UML (Unified Modeling Language)
● Class diagrams: attributes, methods, relationships
● Object modeling examples
● Translating a real-world problem into Java classes
● Understanding associations (HAS-A, IS-A)

Day 5: Inheritance:
● What is inheritance?
● The extends keyword
● Superclass and subclass relationship
● The super keyword for method/constructor calls
● Method overriding
● Inheritance hierarchy examples

Day 6: Encapsulation, Interface, Abstract Classes, and Polymorphism:
● Deep dive into encapsulation and data hiding
● Interfaces and implements keyword
● Abstract classes vs. interfaces
● Real-world analogy of abstract vs. interface
● Polymorphism: compile-time (method overloading) vs. runtime (method overriding)
● Dynamic method dispatch

Prerequisites:
● Week 1 topics covered (Java Basics)
● Working JDK and IDE setup
● Familiarity with Java syntax and structure

How to Use This Repository:
This repository is organized by day-wise folders containing examples, notes, and exercises for each concept covered during Week 2. Navigate through each day's folder to explore source code, UML diagrams, and practice problems.
